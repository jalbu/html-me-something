                    <p>I was born Hollywood, FL. I've lived here most of my life. I used to come

                    <h2>High School/Pre-college</h2>
                    <p>My original high school was the McFatter Technical College And High School in Davie, FL.
                    However, halfway through high school I decided to go to College Academy which happened to be next door
                    at Broward College. It was there were I started to learn how to code. Python was my first programming language
                    that I learned, but I would be a while before I would use python again</p>

                    <h1>College</h1>
                    <p>After high school, I went to the University of South Florida (USF) for college. It was here where I
                    earned my Bachelors in Computer Science. I studied here for 3.5 years until I graduated at 2017.</p>

                    <h1>Work during College</h1>
                    <p>While I was studying at USF, I took a job at the Museum of Science and Industry, where I worked in
                    the facilities department. I maintained various mechanical systems such as the AC air handlers while also
                    preforming electrical, masonry, and plumbing work around the museum campus.</p>

                    <p>I am currently working as a Data Engineer at SmartProcure. I mainly parse purchase order data
                        recieved from various government agencies and send the data to our databases, where we allow
                        customers to view what a government agency spends money on so that they may be able to offer a
                        better deal to the agency.</p>
